# OverVolt-Soldering-Iron.Experiment
Use Ohm's Law to make a "High Powered" Soldering Iron from a Cheap one!

Make a circuit to Up the Voltage and push 45 or 60 watts through a Cheap Soldering Iron! Resistor + Transformer + Triac for Control

This can be VERY Dangerous! 240 to 360 Volts. Wear thick gloves when using it.
